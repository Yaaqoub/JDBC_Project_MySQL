## Getting Started

These instructions will help you run the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
This project is still under development so if you run it, you will still find bugs and some bad executions.

### Prerequisites & Running the prototype

To run this project you need to import it to the eclipse IDE:
  - eclipse -> File -> Open Projects from File System...
  - Directory... -> select the project from file system
After that copy the Jar file from "projet sil\jar files\" to the project in eclipse to run the application properly.
The last thing to do is to import the database from "projet sil\database\" and put it in a MySQL server to run it.
